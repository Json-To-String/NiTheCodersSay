# CodersWhoSayNi

## We demand... a shrubbery!

### one that looks nice. And not too expensive.

HEAD KNIGHT OF NI: Ni!

KNIGHTS OF NI: Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!

ARTHUR: Who are you?

HEAD KNIGHT: We are the Knights Who Say... 'Ni'!

RANDOM: Ni!

ARTHUR: No! Not the Knights Who Say 'Ni'!

HEAD KNIGHT: The same!

BEDEVERE: Who are they?

HEAD KNIGHT: We are the keepers of the sacred words: 'Ni', 'Peng', and 'Neee-wom'!

RANDOM: Neee-wom!

ARTHUR: Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale.

HEAD KNIGHT: The Knights Who Say 'Ni' demand a sacrifice.

ARTHUR: Knights of Ni, we are but simple travellers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.

HEAD KNIGHT: Ni!

KNIGHTS OF NI: Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!...

ARTHUR: Ow! Ow! Ow! Agh!

HEAD KNIGHT: We shall say 'ni' again to you if you do not appease us.

ARTHUR: Well, what is it you want?

HEAD KNIGHT: We want... a shrubbery!

[dramatic chord]

ARTHUR: A what?

KNIGHTS OF NI: Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!

ARTHUR and PARTY: Ow! Oh!

ARTHUR: Please! Please! No more! We will find you a shrubbery.

HEAD KNIGHT: You must return here with a shrubbery, or else, you will never pass through this wood... alive.

ARTHUR: O Knights of Ni, you are just and fair, and we will return with a shrubbery.

HEAD KNIGHT: One that looks nice.

ARTHUR: Of course.

HEAD KNIGHT: And not too expensive.

ARTHUR: Yes.

HEAD KNIGHT: Now... go!

ARTHUR: Old crone!

[rewr!]

[music stops]

Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery?

[dramatic chord]

OLD CRONE: Who sent you?

ARTHUR: The Knights Who Say 'Ni'.

CRONE: Aggh! No! Never! We have no shrubberies here.

ARTHUR: If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will say... we will say... 'ni'.

CRONE: Agh! Do your worst!

ARTHUR: Very well! If you will not assist us voluntarily,... ni!

CRONE: No! Never! No shrubberies!

ARTHUR: Ni!

CRONE: [cough]

BEDEVERE: Nu!

ARTHUR: No, no, no, no, i--

BEDEVERE: Nu!

ARTHUR: No, it's not that. It's 'ni'.

BEDEVERE: Nu!

ARTHUR: No, no. 'Ni'. You're not doing it properly. No.

BEDEVERE: Ni!

ARTHUR and BEDEVERE: Ni!

ARTHUR: That's it. That's it. You've got it.

ARTHUR and BEDEVERE: Ni!

CRONE: Ohh!

BEDEVERE: Ni!

ARTHUR: Ni!

CRONE: Agh!

BEDEVERE: Ni!

ARTHUR: Ni!

BEDEVERE: Ni!

ARTHUR: Ni!

BEDEVERE: Ni!

ROGER THE SHRUBBER: Are you saying 'ni' to that old woman?

ARTHUR: Erm,... yes.

ROGER: Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say 'ni' at will to old ladies. There is a pestilence upon this land. Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.

ARTHUR: Did you say 'shrubberies'?

ROGER: Yes. Shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber. My name is 'Roger the Shrubber'. I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.

BEDEVERE: Ni!

ARTHUR: No! No, no, no! No!

ARTHUR: O Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery. May we go now?

HEAD KNIGHT: It is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels particularly,... but there is one small problem.

ARTHUR: What is that?

HEAD KNIGHT: We are now... no longer the Knights Who Say 'Ni'.

KNIGHTS OF NI: Ni! Shh!

HEAD KNIGHT: Shh! We are now the Knights Who Say 'Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky-pikang-zoop-boing-goodem-zu-owly-zhiv'.

RANDOM: Ni!

HEAD KNIGHT: Therefore, we must give you a test.

ARTHUR: What is this test, O Knights of-- knights who till recently said 'ni'?

HEAD KNIGHT: Firstly, you must find... another shrubbery!

[dramatic chord]

ARTHUR: Not another shrubbery!

RANDOM: Ni!

HEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get the two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.

KNIGHTS OF NI: A path! A path! A path! Ni! Shh! Knights of Ni! Ni! Ni! Shh! Shh!...

HEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest... with... a herring!

[dramatic chord]

KNIGHTS OF NI: A herring!

ARTHUR: We shall do no such thing!

HEAD KNIGHT: Oh, please!

ARTHUR: Cut down a tree with a herring? It can't be done.

KNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh! Aaaugh!

HEAD KNIGHT: Augh! Ohh! Don't say that word.

ARTHUR: What word?

HEAD KNIGHT: I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear.

ARTHUR: How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?

KNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!

HEAD KNIGHT: You said it again!

ARTHUR: What, 'is'?

KNIGHTS OF NI: Agh! No, not 'is'.

HEAD KNIGHT: No, not 'is'. You wouldn't get vary far in life not saying 'is'.

KNIGHTS OF NI: No, not 'is'. Not 'is'.
